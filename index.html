        Hobby is the favorite pastime of a person in this leisure time. It is not his regular business, such as stamp collecting, growing flowers or vegetables, reading books, or any other similar things. My favorite hobby is reading books. I read all kinds of good books, magazines, newspapers etc. I am to read some books for my examination. I read them with much attention. But when I get leisure or spare time I start reading other books that I like. I feel happy if I get a new book every day. I read novels, fairy tales, adventure stories, detective novels, poems, essays etc. I do not like to waste time in idle gossiping. I treat the books as my friends as they delight me even at the time of my danger and loneliness. I spend about an hour every day on reading. I enjoy very much reading any kind of good books. I also acquire knowledge from my reading. It helps me broaden my outlook. So a man must have a hobby that gives pleasure, knowledge and removes the pangs of loneliness.</p>
